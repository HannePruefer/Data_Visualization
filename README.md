# Data visualization with SQL and Tableau with e-commerce data

## Overview and objective

This project shows an analysis of order and customer data from Magist to decide if the company is a good partner for ENIAC entering into the Brazilian market.  
Eniac is an online marketplace specializing in Apple-compatible accessories. It was founded ten years ago in Spain and has since grown and expanded to other neighboring countries.  
Eniac is exploring an expansion to the Brazilian market. The problem for Eniac is the lack of knowledge of such a market.
The company doesnâ€™t have ties with local providers, package delivery services, or customer service agencies.  

The main focus was to understand Magist capability to serve ENIAC as a order management system, stock and warehouse management, product shipment, 
and customer service related to the shipment. Magist is a Brazilian Software as a Service company that offers a centralized order management system  
to connect small and medium-sized stores with the biggest Brazilian marketplaces. 

The task for the data team was to use an SQL database, clean it and work out insights, then take the data to Tableau and create a short presentation.
